# Inky Buy Bot

**Inky Buy Bot** is a Python-based Telegram bot that enables users to buy and sell tokens using ETH on the Ink Layer 2 blockchain. It provides a secure, custodial wallet experience, supports only the InkyFactory (V3) router for swaps, and is designed for robust, 24/7 operation.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Custodial Wallets:** Each Telegram user gets a unique, securely stored wallet.
- **Buy/Sell Tokens:** Swap ETH for tokens and vice versa using the InkyFactory (V3) router. Only tokens with an Inky Factory V3 pool can be traded.
- **Fee Routing:** 1% fee on swaps, routed to a designated fee wallet. Fee is deducted from the user's input for buys, and from the output for sells.
- **Explorer Integration:** Transaction confirmations include a link to the InkOnChain explorer (always 0x-prefixed).
- **Secure Key Management:** Private keys are encrypted at rest and never exposed except to the authenticated user.
- **User-Friendly Telegram UX:** Intuitive command and menu-driven interface, with clear error messages for unsupported tokens and pending transactions.

## üß© Project Structure

- `bot.py` ‚Äî Telegram bot logic, user flows, and command handlers.
- `wallet_utils.py` ‚Äî Wallet creation, encryption, storage, and retrieval.
- `swap_handler.py` ‚Äî Swap routing, fee management, and contract interaction.
- `config.py` ‚Äî Network, router, and global constants.
- `SwapRouter02_ABI.json` ‚Äî ABI for Uniswap V3 router.
- `wallets.db` ‚Äî SQLite database for wallet storage (auto-created).

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

### 1. Telegram Bot Commands

- `/start` ‚Äî Initializes a wallet for the user if none exists, displays wallet address and bridge link.
- `/wallet` ‚Äî Shows wallet address and ETH balance.
- `/export_keys` ‚Äî Returns the user's decrypted private key (only to the authenticated user).
- `/reset_wallet` ‚Äî Deletes the old wallet and creates a new one.
- `/buy` ‚Äî Guides the user through buying a token with ETH.
- `/sell` ‚Äî Guides the user through selling a token for ETH.
- `/withdraw` ‚Äî Withdraw ETH or tokens to another address.

All wallet actions are tied to the user's Telegram ID.

### 2. Wallet Security & Storage

- **Wallet Generation:** Uses `eth_account.Account.create()` to generate a new Ethereum wallet.
- **Encryption:** Private keys are encrypted using Fernet (AES-256) from the `cryptography` package.
- **Database:** Wallets are stored in a local SQLite database (`wallets.db`) with the schema:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE wallets (
    telegram_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    address TEXT NOT NULL,
    encrypted_private_key TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );
  ```
- **Access Control:** Only the Telegram user who owns a wallet can access its private key.
- **Key Management:** The encryption key is loaded from an environment variable and never hardcoded.

### 3. Swap Routing & Execution

#### Supported Router

- **SwapRouter02 (InkyFactory):**
  - Used for V3 liquidity pairs deployed via InkyFactory.com.
  - Contract call: `exactInputSingle` for both buy and sell.
  - For buys: ETH is wrapped to WETH automatically.
  - For sells: WETH is unwrapped to ETH after the swap using the `withdraw` function.

#### Pool Selection Logic

- The bot only allows trades for tokens with a V3 pool on Inky Factory.
- If no V3 pool exists for the token, the trade is rejected with a clear error message.

#### Fee Handling

- **1% Fee:** On every swap, 1% of the ETH value is sent to a designated fee wallet.
  - For buys: Fee is deducted from the ETH sent, and the remainder is swapped.
  - For sells: After the swap and unwrap, 1% of the received ETH is sent to the fee wallet, and the remainder is returned to the user.
- **Fee Transactions:** All fee transfers are signed and sent from the user's wallet.
- **Sequential Handling:** Each transaction (fee, swap, unwrap, return) is sent one at a time, waiting for each to be mined before proceeding. All transactions use 2x the current gas price for speed and reliability.
- **Only the swap transaction hash is shown to the user in confirmations.**

### 4. Explorer API Usage

- **Token Balances:** The bot fetches token balances using:
  ```
  https://explorer.inkonchain.com/api/v2/addresses/{user_address}/token-balances
  ```
- **Transaction Links:** All transaction confirmations include a link to the InkOnChain explorer:
  ```
  https://explorer.inkonchain.com/tx/{tx_hash}
  ```
  (Always 0x-prefixed)

### 5. Security Practices

- **Private Key Encryption:** All private keys are encrypted at rest using Fernet (AES-256).
- **Access Control:** Only the Telegram user who owns a wallet can access its private key.
- **No Sensitive Data in Code:** No private keys, sensitive API keys, or .env secrets are included in the codebase or documentation.
- **Error Handling:** The bot gracefully handles errors such as unsupported tokens, failed swaps, and RPC timeouts. If a previous transaction is pending, the user is told to wait before making another trade.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Deployment

- The bot is designed to run as a long-lived process (e.g., on AWS Lambda, EC2, or any server).
- All configuration (RPC URL, chain ID, fee wallet, encryption key, bot token) is loaded from environment variables.
- **Do not** commit your `.env` file or any sensitive keys to version control.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development & Extensibility

- **Modular Design:** Each major function (wallet, swap, config) is in its own file for easy upgrades.
- **ABIs:** Router ABIs are loaded from JSON files and selected dynamically based on router type.
- **Logging:** All user actions are logged to `bot.log` for audit and debugging.
